summary: Design and build a drone to compete in a search and rescue competition.
---

AUVSI (Association For Unmanned Vehicle Systems International) hosts a student unmanned aerial systems competition each year.  The goal of the compeition is to complete in various search and rescue tasks.  For each task, a team can be awarded a level of completion, ranging from threshold (requirements just met) to objective (exceeding requirements).  Some tasks include finding alphanumeric targets on the ground, identifying QR codes, and flying to waypoints.

My role in Drone Tech was to identify the alphanumeric targets, by characteristic and location.  At this year's competition, our team was tied for fifth in the performance section of the AUVSI competition.  The location of the targets could be identified reliably within 100 feet.
