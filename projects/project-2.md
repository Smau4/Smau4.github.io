summary: Remaking an anomaly detecting code in another programming language to increase efficiency.

A professor at the university created code to sift through a large amount of bits and find anomalies within the code.  To do this, he built a tree with the estimated probabilities of different bit sequences.  The code was originally written in Matlab, the programming language he was most familiar with.  However, as the data became larger and larger, the code became much slower.  So, we began to intergrate the code into Python.  I did not know Python, so I learned it during the semester.

The code in Python created a tree, and updated it as new bits were added.  As new bits were added, the size of the tree grew larger.  I was able to integrate my knowledge of data structures and Python to create baseline code that worked for a small number of bits.
