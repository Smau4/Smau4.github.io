summary: My team developed a robot in six weeks to compete in a regional First Robotics Competition.
---

The FIRST Robotics Competition is an event that give students a taste of engineering constraints.  Teams have six weeks to design and build a large robot to play an annual game, which changes every year.  Students learn professionalism, sportsmanship, workmanship, and cooperation, in addition to many technical skills, such as programming or welding. 

In my FIRST Robotics team, I was a core programmer.  It was FIRST Robotics that inspired me to become a computer engineer.  All of the code was done in C++.  I have written code for a drive system, an autonomously aiming basketball shooter, an autonomous climbing mechanism, and much more.  I also learned how to work with others in a technical environment.
