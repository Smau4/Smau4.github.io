	To be honest, I'm not very fond of configuration management.  I did not decide to become a computer engineer because of my sheer love of Git and Github.  It seems so unnecessary to record obvious changes to a build - and personally, I've rarely pulled a previous version from the master branch.  To me, configuration management more of a necessary evil than a wonderful innovation.  Still though, I understand the importance of Git and Github.  It documents the previous builds.  It tracks how the program has changed, and the reason.  It allows for multiple people to work on the same document.  Any person can look at the commits and history and they will know exactly what changed from build to build.
