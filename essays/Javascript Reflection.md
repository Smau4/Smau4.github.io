This was my first experience with Javascript.  Compared to Java and C++, Javascript feels more natural.  I'm very happy that I don't need to worry as much about type and cast conversions.  Functions too, are much simpler.  Javascript is simpler than other languages I've used - it's more general, and less picky about variables and syntax than either of Java or C++.

I also enjoyed athletic software engineering.  For me, it's fast paced but not stressful.  Exercises are like mental gym sets.  It's also easy to stop after a few exercises, and begin at a later time.  As a person who has difficult sitting down for six hours coding straight, this type of learning is much more fun.
