Growing up, I always had an affinity for math and science.  I like to analyze and discover.  However, it wasn't until I joined robotics in my sophomore year of high school when I discovered something really cool.  I joined the software team oh a whim - I just wanted to avoid the mentor on the mechnical team, who was angry and impatient.  

However, I really enjoyed my experiences in programming.  Programming followed a logical progression that always came naturally to me.  I was easily frustrated by the time and effort it took to debug, but when the code worked, it was something special.  So when I came to the Unviersity of Hawaii, I had already decided to become a computer engineer.

School has helped me progress and develop as a programmer.  I've been exposed to many different languages, data structure, and software tools.  I would really like to build the next big application, or make develop cutting edge technology.  I would like to work with more like-minded individuals to create bigger and better software.
